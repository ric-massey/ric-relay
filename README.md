# ric-relay

Ric Massey's personal website — a terminal-styled "relay" for family and friends to
follow what he's up to (Orrin, climbing, training, photos, write-ups) without having
to ask.

**Live:** https://ric-massey.github.io/ric-relay/
**Stack:** hand-written HTML/CSS/JS. No build step, no framework, no dependencies.
**Deploy:** edit a file, `git push` to `main`, GitHub Pages redeploys automatically.

> **Working on this repo with an AI assistant?** Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first —
> it captures the conventions and the hard rules (no location data, one project only,
> keep each room's menu native to its theme).

## The idea

This is not a normal blog. The pitch is: *"imagine it's literally my own internet."*
The home page is a terminal hub, and every other page is a **room** styled to look like
the real app for that world — climbing looks like Mountain Project, training looks like
Strava, and so on. Each room is its own self-contained `.html` file.

## Pages

| File | Room | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | The Relay | Landing terminal — boot sequence + working command line (try `help`) |
| `orrin.html` | Orrin | Plain-language tour of Orrin plus live public project activity from GitHub |
| `psyche.html` | Psyche | Human-systems field notebook — mood, criteria, substances, and evidence |
| `climbing.html` | Climbing | Mountain-Project-style route ledger — projects, ticks, objectives |
| `training.html` | Training | Strava-style feed — runs, workouts, health (live feed still TODO) |
| `exploration.html` | Exploration | Space deck — experiments and the game dock here |
| `workbench.html` | Workbench | Blueprint board of random / half-finished projects |
| `captures.html` | Captures | Darkroom contact sheet for photos |
| `log.html` | Log | Long-form write-ups, trip reports, Apex VOD reviews |
| `updates.html` | — | Legacy redirect to the homepage's latest-signal banner |
| `systems.html` | — | Legacy redirect from the former Orrin URL to `orrin.html` |
| `map.html` | Map | Locked placeholder — the real private map app lives elsewhere, with real auth |
| `404.html` | — | On-brand "signal lost" page for mistyped URLs |
| `playground/` | — | Standalone HTML experiments, including the Starfield interstellar flight game |
| `projects/` | — | Self-contained sub-projects, each linked from a room (see below) |
| `photos/` | — | Web-optimized images (originals stay out of git in `_photo-originals/`) |
| `notes.js` | — | Homepage "transmissions" — the one file you edit by hand to post a note |
| `latest.js` | — | Curated newest additions shown in each room's native latest-signal banner |
| `effects.js` | — | Persistent visual modes and the reduced-motion-aware, 24-frame resident cat shared by rooms and projects |
| `EASTER_EGGS.md` | — | Complete field guide to every hidden command and typed surprise |

## Projects

Standalone builds live in `projects/` and are surfaced from the room that fits them:

| Project | Linked from | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `projects/spacetime/` | Exploration | "The Geometry of Spacetime" — interactive special-relativity explainer |
| `projects/farlight/` | Exploration | "FARLIGHT" — playable momentum and landing-feel prototype |
| `projects/the-shape-of-harm/` | Psyche | Evidence-informed interactive research framework for comparing psychoactive-substance harms |
| `projects/siege-conductor/` | Workbench | Star Wars viewing-companion PWA (add-to-home-screen app) |
| `projects/autism-reflection.html` | Psyche | Long-form personal reflection on the DSM-5 autism criteria |
| `projects/state-of-mind-line/` | Psyche | Animated bipolar mood-pattern visualization |

These are self-contained and may carry their own assets/fonts — that's fine; the
"no dependencies" rule applies to the relay's own room pages, not embedded projects.

## Playground

`playground/starfield.html` is a collision-and-distance flight game linked from
Exploration. Normal cruise is shown as `1 c`; holding click, touch, or Space engages
the fictional `10,000,000 c` warp drive. The distance display moves from light-seconds
through light-years, and new systems are separated by several light-years. Stars are
much larger than their planets, planets use reflected directional light instead of a
self-glow, moons and comets stay small, and a black hole replaces roughly one in 500
generated stars. A sparse particle layer shows motion while colored stars, nebulae,
and procedural galaxies form the deep field and grow as you fly toward them. Object
sizes remain compressed enough to keep the game playable.

## Navigation

There is **no shared nav bar**. Every room has its own menu, styled to match that
room's theme (MP tabs on climbing, a Strava underline bar on training, a synaptic
pill switcher in Orrin, case-file tabs in Psyche, a film strip on captures, and so on). They all link to the
**same set of rooms with the same labels** — only the styling differs. If you add or
rename a room, update the menu on **every** page (see `AGENTS.md`).

When served on the web, Relay home links normalize to the clean site root instead of
leaving `/index.html` in the address. Their `index.html` markup remains as a fallback so
the pages still work when opened directly from disk.

## Relay terminal

Type `help` for the current command list. Useful shortcuts include `/clear`, `tree`,
`projects`, `find <word>`, `open <target>`, `latest`, `random`, `uptime`, and `reboot`.
Commands accept a leading slash, project shortcuts are searchable, and `↑`/`↓` plus
`Tab` provide history and completion.

## Updating content

Each page keeps its editable content in a loudly-commented block near the top of the
file — copy the example block, edit, done.

- **Post a homepage note:** edit `notes.js`.
- **Change the clickable newest-item banners:** edit `latest.js` once; every room
  presents the same curated addition in its own visual language.
- **`orrin.html` explains the architecture in plain language** and pulls public code
  activity from the GitHub API. It does not expose Orrin's private runtime state.
- **Never** commit real location data anywhere in this repo (see the map page).

## Easter eggs

The Relay has hidden terminal commands, typed project codes, and a few strange visual
interactions. The complete, intentionally spoiler-filled registry lives in
[`EASTER_EGGS.md`](EASTER_EGGS.md).

For the biggest ones, type `lsd` or `shrooms` into the homepage terminal. The chosen
visual mode persists as you move through rooms and projects. Refresh any page or return
to the Relay and type `sober` to turn it off. Motion is automatically disabled when the
visitor has requested reduced motion.
